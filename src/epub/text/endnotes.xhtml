					<p>We know that there may be, and have been, cases in which the soldier possesses purer motives. An invasion may rouse the national patriotism and arm a people for the unmingled purpose of defending themselves. Here is a definite purpose, a purpose which every individual understands and is interested in: and if he die under such circumstances, we do not deny that his motives are patriotic. The actions to which they prompt, are, however, a separate consideration, and depend for their qualities on the rectitude of war itself. Motives may be patriotic, when actions are bad. I might, perhaps, benefit my country by blowing up a fleet, of which the cargo would injure our commerce. My motive may be patriotic, but my action is vicious. It is not sufficiently borne in mind, that patriotism, even much purer than this, is not necessarily a virtue. "Christianity," says Bishop Watson, "does not encourage particular patriotism, in opposition to general benignity." And the reason is easy of discovery. Christianity is designed to benefit, not a community, but the world. If it unconditionally encouraged particular patriotism, the duties of a subject of one state would often be in opposition to those of a subject of another. Christianity, however, knows no such inconsistencies; and whatever patriotism, therefore, is opposed, in its exercise, to the <i>general welfare of mankind,</i> is, in no degree, a virtue. <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Nor is the preacher inconsistent with <i>Apostles</i> alone. He is also inconsistent with himself. In another discourse, delivered in the preceding year, he says: "The safety of nations <i>is not to be sought</i> in arts or <i>in arms. War reverses,</i> with respect to its objects, <i>all the rules of morality.</i> It is nothing less than a temporary <i>repeal of all the principles of virtue.</i> It is a system, out of which <i>almost all the virtues are excluded,</i> and in which <i>nearly all the vices are incorporated.</i> In instructing us to consider <i>a portion of our fellow-creatures as the proper objects of enmity,</i> it removes, as far as they are concerned, <i>the basis of all society, of all civilization and virtue;</i> for the basis of these, is the <i>good will due to every individual of the species."</i> - "Religion," then, we are told, "sheds its selectest influence over that which repeals all the principles of virtue" - over that "in which nearly all the vices are incorporated!" What "religion" it is which does this, I do not know - but I know that it is not the religion of Christ. T<small>RUTH</small> never led into contradictions like these. Well was it said that we cannot serve two masters. The quotations which we have given, are evidence sufficient that he who <i>holds with the one neglects the other.</i> <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
